[move to discussion... this is not intro material: However, closing the feedback loop can also help in the exploration process of the inverse dynamics map and introduce the system to lower error regions which will speedup the process of learning and improve the precision of the inverse map.]


[Move to discussion: Systems that solely (or heavily) depend on error correction using rich sensory feedback will suffer greatly when there is noise or delays in the feedback. In addition, information is not cheap and full state observability is not applicable in real world applications [not true...many ral world systems are designe to be observable! Ali: The sentence is talking about full state observability. e.g.: the open AI hand where they had 30 cameras recording it at the same time. Sure, sensory feedback is cheap but for example, for vision, we need to watch the road when passing a street and cannot provide visual information all the time]. Therefore, systems that can minimally rely on feedback and are robust to its variations are highly preferred.]
